# Waiter Tips Prediction Project

This Jupyter notebook is part of the Waiter Tips Prediction project. The goal is to explore and analyze a dataset of tips given to waiters in a restaurant and to build a machine learning model that can predict the amount of tip a waiter might receive based on various factors. The project covers data loading, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, preprocessing (including encoding categorical variables), and model training and evaluation using Linear Regression.

## Contents

1. **Introduction and Dataset Overview**
   - Import necessary libraries
   - Load the dataset
   - Check for null values and descriptive statistics
   
2. **Data Visualization**
   - Visualize the relationship between total bill and tips
   - Explore the impact of the number of people at a table on tips
   - Analyze tips given by day of the week
   
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Transform categorical variables into numerical values
   
4. **Model Building**
   - Split the data into training and test sets
   - Train a Linear Regression model
   - Evaluate the model's performance
   
5. **Prediction**
   - Make a prediction with the trained model for a given input

## Goal

The primary objective of this project is to utilize exploratory data analysis and machine learning to understand factors influencing the tips given to waiters and to predict tip amounts for future observations.

By the end of this notebook, we will have a trained Linear Regression model capable of predicting waiter tips with a certain level of accuracy, providing valuable insights into customer tipping behavior.
